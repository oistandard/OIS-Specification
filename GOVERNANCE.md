# Governance

The Open In-Store Standard (OIS) is guided by a Technical Steering Committee
(TSC) and an open community process.

## Technical Steering Committee

The TSC sets the roadmap, resolves disputes, and approves releases.

* Membership is listed in `README.md`.
* Decisions are made in public meetings or via recorded issues and PRs.

## Working Groups

Working groups may be formed for specific layers or topics. Each group should
maintain its own notes and proposals within `proposals/`.

## Releases

Drafts and releases live in `versions/`. A release is approved by the TSC and
tagged in the repository.
