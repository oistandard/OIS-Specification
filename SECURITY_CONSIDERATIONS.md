# Security Considerations

OIS will define security and privacy requirements for in-store media systems,
including device authentication, access control, and data minimization.

This document will expand as the spec matures. For now, proposals that introduce
new data flows should include:

* Threat model assumptions
* Authentication and authorization requirements
* Data retention guidance
* Privacy safeguards for non-PII analytics
