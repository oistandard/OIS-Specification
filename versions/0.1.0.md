# Open In-Store Standard (OIS) 0.1.0 (Draft)

This draft defines the initial structure of the OIS specification layers.
Each layer includes payload examples and schemas inline in `endpoints/`.

## Status

Draft. Not yet approved by the TSC.

## Conformance

OIS-compliant implementations MUST follow the normative requirements in this
specification and MAY include optional extensions as described by each layer.

## Roles and Data Flow

OIS defines a single API standard with optional layer implementation. Providers
publish and ingest data to the Service/Platform side, and the Service/Platform
delivers media, configuration, or signals back to providers. Endpoint catalog
details live in `endpoints/`.

## OIS-Core

Defines shared conventions across all layers.

* Authentication and authorization
* Canonical identifiers
* Timestamp, localization, and versioning

### Discovery

Providers SHOULD expose a public discovery document at
`/.well-known/ois` under their OIS endpoint. This document describes
supported OIS layers, authentication requirements, and transport security
so clients can configure access before making authenticated requests.

Examples and schema:

Included in `endpoints/ois-core/provider-to-service.md`.

## OIS-Display

Screen and inventory definition layer.

Examples and schema:

Included in `endpoints/ois-display/provider-to-service.md`.

## OIS-Media

Media lifecycle and delivery layer.

Examples and schema:

Included in `endpoints/ois-media/service-to-provider.md` and
`endpoints/ois-media/provider-to-service.md`.

## OIS-Proof-of-Play

Measurement and compliance layer.

Examples and schema:

Included in `endpoints/ois-proof-of-play/provider-to-service.md`.

## OIS-Sense

Sensor and engagement layer.

Examples and schema:

Included in `endpoints/ois-sense/provider-to-service.md`.

## OIS-Location

Physical environment and location intelligence layer.

Examples and schema:

Included in `endpoints/ois-location/provider-to-service.md`.

## OIS-Events

Real-time signaling and interaction layer.

Examples and schema:

Included in `endpoints/ois-events/provider-to-service.md`.

## OIS-Commerce

Media-to-transaction bridge layer.

Examples and schema:

Included in `endpoints/ois-commerce/provider-to-service.md` and
`endpoints/ois-commerce/service-to-provider.md`.
