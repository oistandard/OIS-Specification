# Open In-Store Standard (OIS) 0.1.0 (Draft)

This draft defines the initial structure of the OIS specification layers.
Each layer includes payload examples and schemas inline in `endpoints/`.

## Status

Draft. Not yet approved by the TSC.

## Conformance

OIS-compliant implementations MUST follow the normative requirements in this
specification and MAY include optional extensions as described by each layer.

## Roles and Data Flow

OIS defines a single API standard with optional layer implementation. Services
publish and ingest data to the Platform side, and the Platform delivers media,
configuration, or signals back to services. Endpoint catalog details live in
`endpoints/`.

## OIS-Core

Defines shared conventions across all layers.

* Authentication and authorization
* Canonical identifiers
* Timestamp, localization, and versioning

### Discovery

Services SHOULD expose a public discovery document at
`/.well-known/ois` under their OIS endpoint. This document describes
supported OIS layers, authentication requirements, and transport security
so clients can configure access before making authenticated requests.

Examples and schema:

Included in `endpoints/ois-core/service-to-platform.md`.

## OIS-Display

Screen and inventory definition layer.

Examples and schema:

Included in `endpoints/ois-display/service-to-platform.md`.

## OIS-Media

Media lifecycle and delivery layer.

Examples and schema:

Included in `endpoints/ois-media/platform-to-service.md` and
`endpoints/ois-media/service-to-platform.md`.

## OIS-Proof-of-Play

Measurement and compliance layer.

Examples and schema:

Included in `endpoints/ois-proof-of-play/service-to-platform.md`.

## OIS-Sense

Sensor and engagement layer.

Examples and schema:

Included in `endpoints/ois-sense/service-to-platform.md`.

## OIS-Location

Physical environment and location intelligence layer.

Examples and schema:

Included in `endpoints/ois-location/service-to-platform.md`.

## OIS-Events

Real-time signaling and interaction layer.

Examples and schema:

Included in `endpoints/ois-events/service-to-platform.md`.

## OIS-Commerce

Media-to-transaction bridge layer.

Examples and schema:

Included in `endpoints/ois-commerce/service-to-platform.md` and
`endpoints/ois-commerce/platform-to-service.md`.
