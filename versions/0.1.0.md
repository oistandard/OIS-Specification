# Open In-Store Standard (OIS) 0.1.0 (Draft)

This draft defines the initial structure of the OIS specification layers.
Each layer includes JSON payload examples in `examples/`.

## Status

Draft. Not yet approved by the TSC.

## Conformance

OIS-compliant implementations MUST follow the normative requirements in this
specification and MAY include optional extensions as described by each layer.

## Roles and Data Flow

OIS defines a single API standard with optional layer implementation. Providers
publish and ingest data to the Service/Platform side, and the Service/Platform
delivers media, configuration, or signals back to providers. Role-specific
details live in `layers/`.

Endpoint catalog details live in `endpoints/`.

## OIS-Core

Defines shared conventions across all layers.

* Authentication and authorization
* Canonical identifiers
* Timestamp, localization, and versioning

### Discovery

Providers SHOULD expose a public discovery document at
`/.well-known/ois` under their OIS endpoint. This document describes
supported OIS layers, authentication requirements, and transport security
so clients can configure access before making authenticated requests.
